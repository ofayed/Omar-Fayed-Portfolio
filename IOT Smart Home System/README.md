# IOT Smart Home CO detection System
Using IOT a smart Carbon Monoxide detection system was implemented to protect homes from poisoning. The project was implemented on Arduino board
and integrated with buzzers and LEDs, humidity sensors and heat sensors. The project was further upgraded to upload the sensor results on a cloud dashboard
so it can be accessed remotely. Also, the board was programmed to connect to smartphones using BLE to turn on/off the LED's.
