# Distributed Systems Project
This is one of the major projects I have worked on during my undergraduate studies. The project's intention was to create a end-to-end distributed system
that allows it's users to share pictures but allowing the receiver limited number of views for the picture and the sender can alter the number of access
for the picture at any point of time. The servers were designed to follow a distributed election algorithm to balance the load evenly between them.
Also Fault Tolerance was implemented to take care of the failure of any of the servers at any point of time. The project was implemented using Rust.
